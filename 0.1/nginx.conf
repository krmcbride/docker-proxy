  # Proxy

  # HTTP 1.1 support
  proxy_http_version 1.1;

  # When proxying to another server, the speed of two different connections will affect 
  # the client's experience: the connection from the client to nginx, and the connection 
  # from nginx to the backend server. Nginx has the ability to adjust its behavior based 
  # on whichever one of these connections you wish to optimize. Without buffers, data is 
  # sent from the proxied server and immediately begins to be transmitted to the client. 
  # If the clients are assumed to be fast, buffering can be turned off in order to get 
  # the data to the client as soon as possible. With buffers, the Nginx proxy will 
  # temporarily store the backend's response and then feed this data to the client. If 
  # the client is slow, this allows the Nginx server to close the connection to the backend 
  # sooner. It can then handle distributing the data to the client at whatever pace is possible.
  # When disabling buffering, Nginx will still use buffers if the upstream is faster than 
  # the client, but it will immediately try to flush data to the client instead of waiting 
  # for the buffer to pool. If the client is slow, this can cause the upstream connection 
  # to remain open until the client can catch up. When buffering is "off" only the buffer 
  # defined by the proxy_buffer_size directive will be used. By default, the buffer size is 
  # equal to the size of one buffer set by the proxy_buffers directive, which by default
  # is equal to one memory page. This is either 4K or 8K, depending on platform.
  proxy_buffering off;

  # The "Host" header is of particular importance in most proxying scenarios. By default, 
  # this will be set to the value of $proxy_host, a variable that will contain the domain 
  # name or IP address and port taken directly from the proxy_pass definition. This is 
  # selected by default as it is the only address Nginx can be sure the upstream server 
  # responds to (as it is pulled directly from the connection info).
  # In most cases, you will want to set the "Host" header to the $host variable. It is the 
  # most flexible and will usually provide the proxied servers with a "Host" header filled 
  # in as accurately as possible. This variable is equal to line Host in the header of the
  # request or name of the server processing the request if the Host header is not available.
  # This variable may have a different value from $http_host in such cases: 1) when the Host 
  # input header is absent or has an empty value, $host equals to the value of server_name 
  # directive; 2)when the value of Host contains port number, $host doesn't include that port 
  # number. $host's value is always lowercase.

  # begins by making a clear-text request, which is later upgraded to a newer http protocol.

  # the Nginx server's IP address to the end.
